* Project for COMP 1930 *

This is a web project that generates users with vegan snack recipes based on a specific 
category and ingredient chosen by the user. By interacting with a questionnaire, the 
user is given two recipes based on their choice or they can choose to skip the question 
for a broad recipe result.
